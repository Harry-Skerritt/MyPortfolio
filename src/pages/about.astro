        <Experience title="University of the West of England" start_date="09/2025" end_date="Present" role="Student">
            <ExpNote>
                I am currently studying BSc Games Technology at UWE Bristol, which has so far given me a good insight
                into the games industry, whilst also teaching me new, invaluable skills from Game Engines to what makes good game mechanics.
            </ExpNote>

            <ExpNote>
                I have also further developed my programming knowledge by learning C++ and C#, through using Unity Engine and SFML.
                These skills have also opened my eyes to lower level engine systems, which is an aspect I would like to keep studying both in and out of university.
            </ExpNote>
        </Experience>

        <Experience title="Prince William School" start_date="04/2024" end_date="08/2024" role="Unqualified Computer Science Teacher">
            <ExpNote>
                Within this role I had the responsibilities of teaching a small class of Year 12 students,
                and assisted in teaching a class of Year 10's.
            </ExpNote>

            <ExpNote>
                I found this role very interesting and view it as a very valuable experience,
                as it helped me further develop my knowledge of computer science and programming, whilst also teaching me new skills.

        <Experience title="Prince William School" start_date="10/2023" end_date="08/2024" role="Teaching Assistant">
            <ExpNote>
                Whilst not directly related to being a game developer, this job was a very valuable experience to me, as it taught me many good life and professional skills.
            </ExpNote>

            <ExpNote>
                This job focused mainly within the SEND department which whilst challenging at times, was also very rewarding.
